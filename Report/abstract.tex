  The relationship between a type system's specification and the
  implementation of the type checker is a recurring issue when writing
  compilers for programming languages and it is an ongoing question if
  -- and if so, how -- the formal description of a type system can be
  used to support the compiler writer when implementing the type
  checking phase. In this paper we propose type systems formalized by
  constraint-based inference rules to form an ideal abstraction to
  accomplish the task of automatically deriving type checking
  functionality from them. We develop a set of algorithms employing
  the constraint-based flavor of the rules to perform type checks and
  present the design and implementation of a \textsc{Haskell} library
  utilizing these algorithms to provide functionality for the type
  checking phase based on the chosen abstraction.
